# Slider-Crank-Mechanism-with-GUI
Program simulates the slider crank mechanism along with velocity and position vector plot along with GUI.

## Langauage Used :- 
Matlab is used for coding the GUI and for plotting the complete code. Inbuilt GUIDE is not used here for making the GUI. Uicontrol funtin is used to make GUI. Simple For loops and function are used for plotting and simulating.

## How to use :-
- Fork the Repository and download all the script files.
- Run the GUI file among all the script files and then enjoy.

## Future Advancements :- 
- Improve tthe speed of program
- Include more functionalities such as speed control, etc.
- Change the GUI code and use better GUI software such as Java or Python.
- Expand this project for Fourbar and Double Crank Mechanism.
