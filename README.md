# Slider-Crank-Mechanism-with-GUI
Program simulates the slider crank mechanism along with velocity and position vector plot along with GUI.

## Source of Idea :-
- Main idea of making making this project is to make an open sorce program where you can just feed the values get your simulation and vector plot. 
- This project is also for helping those people who are finding difficulties in coding the same thing.

## Langauage Used and Functionalities available at present :- 
- Matlab is used for coding the GUI and for plotting the complete code. Inbuilt GUIDE is not used here for making the GUI. Uicontrol funtin is used to make GUI. Simple For loops and function are used for plotting and simulating.
- You can tweek lengths of links or you change the speed of rotation of crank, or you can even pause the simualtion and then resume it.(more to be added)

## How to use :-
- Fork the Repository and download all the script files.
- You can run the code in matlab if you have, or you can use Octave which is open form of matlab.
- Run the GUI file among all the script files and then enjoy.

## Future Advancements :- 
- Improve the speed of program
- Include more functionalities such as speed control(which is done now),showing Transmission angle and various other parameters, etc.
- Want contributors for improving the present GUI code and for using better GUI providing languages such as Python or Java.
- Want contributors for expanding this project for Fourbar,Double Crank Mechanism, etc.
