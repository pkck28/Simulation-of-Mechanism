# Simulation of Mechanism
Program simulates movements of simple SilderCrank and Withworth Mechansim along with their Position, Velocity, Acceleration vector plot along with GUI.

## Langauage Used and Functionalities available at present :- 
- You can choose which mechanism you want.
- You can set various parameters of mechanism.
- You will get Positon, Velocity and Acceleration Vector Plot.
- You can even pause the simualtion and then resume it.

## How to use :-
- Fork the Repository and download all the script files.
- You can run the code in matlab. Don't run the program through Octave because doesn't have required inbuilt function (Uicontrol). You can only view the code in octave.
- Run the MainGUI file among all the script files and then enjoy.

## Future Advancements :- 
- Improve the speed of program.
- Include more functionalities such showing Transmission angle and various other parameters, etc.
- Want contributors for improving the present GUI code and for using better GUI providing languages such as Python or Java.
- Want contributors for expanding this project for Fourbar Mechanism, Double Crank Mechanism, Various Inversions of a Single Mechanism etc.
- Suggestion are always welcomed and it would be even more good if you contribute your suggestion.
